# Todo-Project
A backbone.js todo list webapp.

This project uses backbone.js and is based on the backbone example Todo app by Jerome Gravel-Niquet (http://backbonejs.org/examples/todos/). 

It uses local storage to store data but can be manually exported and imported to a local hard drive, via the import and export buttons. The "Clear All!" button deletes all local storage data for this app.

This project uses backbone.js and localstorage to make a saveable and loadable todo-list.

Currently it needs some optimization and code cleanup.
This version is the original submission from 2014.
